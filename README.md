# 🎓 Student Assistant Web App

Welcome to **Student Assistant** — a simple full-stack web app built with **React** (frontend) and **Flask** (backend).  
This project was created as part of my **30-day Full-Stack Developer Internship** at **Skillmate AI**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Student Assistant helps students learn programming topics through:
- A **login system**.
- A **topic-wise chatbot** for Python fundamentals.
- An interactive dashboard.
- Fun facts & daily programming quotes.
- Clean UI with modern design.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python, Flask, Flask-CORS
- **Deployment:** Local development with Node & Python virtual environment

## 📂 Project Structure

- student-assistant/
- ├── frontend/ # React app
- └── backend/ # Flask app (API)



## ✅ Getting Started



## 1. Run the Frontend (React)
- cd student-assistant
- cd frontend
- npm install
- npm start
- Runs the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.

## 2. Run the Backend (Flask)
- cd student-assistant
- cd backend

On Windows
- venv\Scripts\activate

On Mac/Linux
- source venv/bin/activate

- python app.py

The backend will start on http://localhost:5000


🛠 Available Frontend Scripts
Inside the frontend/ directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint into your project. All commands except eject will still work but will use the copied configuration. This gives you full control over the project setup.

You never have to use eject, and the default setup works well for small and medium-sized projects.
