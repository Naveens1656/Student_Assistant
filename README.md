## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Run the Frontend (React)


cd student-assistant
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Runs the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.

2. Run the Backend (Flask)

cd student-assistant
cd backend

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

python app.py


python app.py
The backend will start on http://localhost:5000

üõ† Available Frontend Scripts
Inside the frontend/ directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can‚Äôt go back!

This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint into your project. All commands except eject will still work but will use the copied configuration. This gives you full control over the project setup.

You never have to use eject, and the default setup works well for small and medium-sized projects.
